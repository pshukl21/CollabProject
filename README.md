## Overview

Our primary goal is to predict the winner of NBA games, given the names of both teams that are playing.

## Installation

In addition to standard Python libraries used in data analysis (e.g., `numpy`, `pandas`), several of our notebooks rely on the `torch`, `torchvision`, and `sklearn` libraries.

Make sure to install these before running.

## Project Structure

As of 7/20/25, we have three scripts we are currently tweaking and a data directory that contains `.csv` files of any data used throughout our scripts.

We would like to have directories dedicated to various modeling approaches.

## Roadmap

- [x] Autoencoder
- [ ] Feed-forward neural network
